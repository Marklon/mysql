********************************************Troubleshooting and Bonus Commands******************************************

# Creating a user in mysql
> CREATE USER 'mbills'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';

# List current users for the database
> SELECT User FROM mysql.user;


# creating a  database in mysql
> CREATE DATABASE shop;

# granted privileges to a database for a new user in mysql

# Importing a file into Mysql
> source/file/location yourfile.sql

# Alternatively you can pipe the data into mysql from the command line:
$ mysql < yourfile.sql

# If the file doesn't specify a database then you will also need to add that:
> mysql db_name < yourfile.sql

# If you have a password for your dB then
$ mysql -u <username> -p <DBName> < yourfile.sql


# If you receive a socket error when starting mysql, the solution is

# ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib /mysql/mysql.sock' (111)

# This is on Redhat 5.6.31
$ vi /usr/my.cnf 
# On Centos
$ vi /etc/my.cnf
# Include the below parameters
datadir = /var/lib/mysql/
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock



# The other issue I ran into was the inability to change / set my root password
$ sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

# If you get an error during that process you can add this to the my.cnf file mentioned above
# Also for version MySql 5.6.31
# skip-grant-tables

Changing a password in mysql
$ mysql -u root p
mysql> SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('new_password');
