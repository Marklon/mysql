 1. Install and Start mySQL
    # sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb


  2. Configure mySQl to auto restart on boot
    $ systemctl enable mysql

  3.  Create a User within mySQL

    > CREATE USER 'mbills'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
  
    # List current users for the database
    > SELECT User FROM mysql.user;

  4.  Create a database

    > CREATE DATABASE databasename;


  5.  Figure out how to import the sql file data from: linux_projects.sql
  
     # If you have a password for your dB then
      $ mysql -u <username> -p <DBName> < /location/of/yourfile.sql
       
      > source /location/of/sqlyourfile.sql

      # Alternatively you can pipe the data into mysql from the command line:
      $ mysql < yourfile.sql

      # If the file doesn't specify a database then you will also need to add that:
      > mysql db_name < yourfile.sql


  6.  Configure DbViz or Sequel Pro to view the information in your Database remotely
      $ mysql_secure_installation
      # Grant Remote access to users
      
      > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mbills'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;


  7.  Change the port of that mySQL is running on and restart the process.




  8.  Confirm that you can still view your database remotely.

$ vi /usr/my.cnf 
# On Centos
$ vi /etc/my.cnf
# Include the below parameters
datadir = /var/lib/mysql/
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
