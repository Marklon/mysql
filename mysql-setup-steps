# If you receive a socket error when starting mysql, the solution is

# ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib /mysql/mysql.sock' (111)

# This is on Redhat
$ vi /usr/my.cnf 
# On Centos
$ vi /etc/my.cnf
# Include the below parameters
datadir = /var/lib/mysql/
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock



# The other issue I ran into was the inability to change / set my root password
$ sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

# If you get an error during that process you can add this to the my.cnf file mentioned above
# skip-grant-tables
